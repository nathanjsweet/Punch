Introduction

This selector engine is more of an intellectual exercise than an actual offering
for the selector engine field. There is no dearth of good selector engines.The
profibility of actually working on and maintaining an engine will offer dimini-
shing returns throughout the coming years as browsers that don't support the
"querySelector" method drop out of support. The tokeninzing process I've come
up with is what I'm most proud of, I think I have offered something unique to
the way Regular Expressions are being used in current selector engines. Regular
Expressions are expensive to use, but for some reason a lot of selector engines
decide to go their way at the cost of performance.
