Punch JS Selector Engine
========================

There is no dearth of good selector engines.The profibility of actually working
on and maintaining an engine will offer diminishing returns throughout the 
coming years as browsers that don't support the "querySelector" method drop
out of support. 
The tokeninzing process I've come up with is what I'm most proud of, I think
I have offered something unique to the way Regular Expressions are being used
in current selector engines. My approach is similar to Dojo, but I have used
the idea that every selector is composed of a tag a combinator and an expression.
