There is no dearth of good selector engines.The profibility of actually workingon and maintaining an engine will offer diminishing returns throughout the coming years as browsers that don't support the "querySelector" method dropout of support. The tokeninzing process I've come up with is what I'm most proud of, I thinkI have offered something unique to the way Regular Expressions are being usedin current selector engines. My approach is similar to Dojo, but I have used the idea that every selector is composed of a tag a combinator and an expression.
